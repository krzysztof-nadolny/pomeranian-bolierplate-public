        Pop culture used to define a generation, but it seems the cultural,
        music and fashion trends of the 1990s have been recycled, and what
        Generation X considered its rite of passage into adulthood, is being

        from which to enjoy the dulcet tones of everyone from Salt-N-Pepa to
        Rick Astley.
